We will build a deep neural network that can recognize images with an accuracy of 78.4% while explaining the techniques used throughout the process.


Deep Learning: A subset of Machine Learning Algorithms that is very good at recognizing patterns but typically requires a large number of data.


MobileNet model has 27 Convolutions layers which includes 13 depthwise Convolution, 1 Average Pool layer, 1 Fully Connected layer and 1 Softmax Layer.


In terms of Convolution layers, there are: 


13 3x3 Depthwise Convolution
1 3x3 Convolution
13 1x1 Convolution
95% of the time is spent in 1x1 Convolution in MobileNet. This model was developed by Andrew G. Howard and other researchers from Google.
